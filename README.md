## About the Project

This password generator was developed to address the need for strong, customizable passwords in today's digital landscape. With increasing security concerns online, having unique and complex passwords for different services is essential.

### Key Features

- **Customizable Password Length**: Generate passwords from 1 to 20 characters
- **Character Selection**: Include or exclude uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copy functionality for easy use
- **No Server Communication**: All password generation happens client-side for maximum privacy
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Breakpoints for a smooth mobile experience

### Technical Implementation

The password generator is built with vanilla JavaScript, focusing on performance and security. It uses JavaScript's `Math.random()` for randomization, ensuring that passwords are truly random and unpredictable.

The interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, working well on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Development Process

This project started as a simple [scrimba](https://www.scrimba.com) solo project, but as I progressed, it became more complex and ticked every stretch goal given by Scrimba, plus some additional functionalities.

## Possible Future Enhancements

Not guaranteed updates in the future.

- Password strength estimation algorithm
- Password history (stored locally)
- Pronounceable password option
